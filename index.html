        While this page would show up if this folder was uploaded to GitHub, the link to the Number Guesser will not show the &quot;dynamic&quot; nature of the page. The Number Guesser will only work with a server - Visual Server simulates this with the &quot;Local Host&quot; server.

        Hosting with Heroku may be a solution?
